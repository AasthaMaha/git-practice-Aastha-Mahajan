# Troubleshooting Log

## Had problem trying to push changes into GitHUb
**I thought my changes were being pushed, but they weren't showing up in GitHub. Due to that I had to redo the whole process again and it worked the seconde time around.**


## Merge Conflict in README.md
**When merging 'feature-addition' branch into main, a merge conflict happened in the README.md file.**
